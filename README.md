# Code for Code Brewers

Welcome Brewers!
This repository is for Code Brewers !
Gonna be updated for learning Machine Learning and Deep Learning by Pytorch.

## Projects

- Colab

Most beginners have difficulties to start Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) because of hardware and software limits. In this project, I will introduce Colab to begin your first project here. Let's learn how do 'coding' in Colab and language 'Python' little.

- MNIST

The most simple toy project for learning ML and DL.
MNIST is the dataset contains 0 to 9 digit number images with 28*28 pixels.
This project is for beginners so that it only deals with feed-forward neural network.
Of course, it introduces Convolutional Neural Network called CNN but not deeply cause it's gonna be told in CIFAR10 detaily.
I know it's hard to understand of all things such as tensors, model, optimizer, loss function even MNIST for.
Let's learn slowly but steadily.

- CIFAR10

CIFAR10 is the little more complex image dataset than MNIST dataset.
Here I will introduce CNN and how it works.

- Language Model
